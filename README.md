# hello-world
Short presentation :
Apparently I have to introduce myself a bit.
So I'm a 20 year old I live in France and I followed design studies for once ended up being intrigued by architecture and code ... I know it's special. But it's beautiful is what I want to become an archi-designer and full-stack developer. Just that !

Sorry for my English !
